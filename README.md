# BlazorRestApi
.NET 5 REST API made using blazor. Simple CRUD-operations with employees

In this project, I am implementing Repository Pattern, 
Its advantages:
- The code is cleaner and reuseble.
- Loosely coupled systems. It is easy to change the database to another one, for example sqllite to postgresql or etc.
- Real repo can be replaced by fake repo and used during unit-testing.
